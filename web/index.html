			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Sono is a high-level object-oriented and procedural scripting language developed with linguistic
				capabilities in mind. For that it supports multiple operators revolving around phonological analysis
				based upon distinctive features.</p>
			<p>The language is capable of functioning moreover as a general scripting language, with a growing number of
				libraries and the capacity to interface with Java files. The language is small right now and has very
				little following, if any at all,
				but it is a language made to fill a niche that has not yet been assessed. Every day, the gap between the
				sciences and programming becomes smaller and smaller, and the sadly neglected science of Linguistics is
				equally deserving of its time
				in the world of programming. If not by this language does it become widepsread, than at least may it be
				that this language inspire another to take up that mantle.</p>

			<h2>Installation</h2>
			<p>There are no binary releases at the moment, but one can compile the source directly from the Github repo:
			</p>
			<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/Nallantli/Sono
$ cd Sono</pre>
			<p>For Windows:</p>
			<pre>
$ ./build-jar
$ ./build-lib</pre>
			<p>For OSX/Linux:</p>
			<pre>
$ sh build-jar.sh
$ sh build-lib.sh</pre>
			<p>These commands will place all necessary files into their locations in <code>/bin</code>, which can be
				then added to the system path.</p>
			<p>Once the system path is updated, all one needs to do is offer the interpreter a dataset consisting of
				base segmental values. The repo includes a slightly adjusted version of Bruce Hayes' feature chart under
				<code>assets/</code>:</p>
			<pre>
$ sono -d assets/hayes.tsv</pre>
			<p>This will generate the cache, stored in your home directory under <code>.sono/</code>. Now you can entire
				the console or run a file!</p>
			<pre>
$ sono
Sono {VERSION}
Phonological Data Loaded From <{DATA}>
Loaded System Library
></pre>
			<pre>
$ sono examples/hello.so
Hello World!</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="content-block">
			<h2>Hello World</h2>
			<p>Below is the classic "hello, world!" script; with one line the task is done:</p>
			<pre>
<span class="_function">println</span>(<span class="_string">"Hello World!"</span>);</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="content-block">
			<h2>Phonology</h2>
			<p>There are multiple examples to be seen in the repo, but a few minor demonstrations can never be so bad.
			</p>
			<pre>
<span class="_keyword">var</span> rule = <span class="_rule">S |></span> [<span class="_feature">-|syl</span>, <span class="_feature">+|cons</span>, <span class="_feature">+|voice</span>, <span class="_feature">-|nasal</span>] -> [<span class="_feature">-|voice</span>] // <span class="_const">null</span> .. <span class="_string">"#"</span>;</pre>
			<p>That value above is a Rule, a phonological transformation rule. When applied to a Word, it transforms
				that value accordingly. The rule above is a final-consonant devoicing rule, so any consonant at the end
				of a Word that is not a nasal will
				become [-voice].</p>
			<pre>
<span class="_function">println</span>(<span class="_string">`taːg`</span> >> rule);
<span class="_function">println</span>(<span class="_string">`taːgə`</span> >> rule);</pre>
			<p>Output:</p>
			<pre>
taːk
taːgə</pre>
			<p>Note that the second Word is unaffected - it does not end with a consonant. Rules can be much more
				powerful and versatile using a variety of tokens and parameters further explained in the repo (but soon
				to be transported here).</p>
